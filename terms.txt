You may acquire the Token only if you possess professional knowledge and you have assessed all potential risks.

Any acquisition of the Token in terms of the Sale should only be undertaken by individuals and representatives of legal entities who have significant knowledge, experience, and the understanding of cryptocurrencies, cryptographic tokens and blockchain-based software and services.

By acquiring the Token or participating in the Sale, you expressly acknowledge that you have fully understood all the potential risks, uncertainty, costs, benefits of the Sale, and the Token.

When acquiring the Token and participating in the Sale you shall consider and accept the following:

� The Sale shall not be treated as an offer for investment and the Sale does not constitute a proposal of securities in any country or state unless otherwise decided by a regulator.

� The Sale is not available for citizens or residents of Afghanistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Central African Republic, Cuba, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Democratic People�s Republic of Korea (North Korea), Eritrea, Ethiopia, Guinea-Bissau, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Lebanon, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Uganda, Vanuatu, Yemen, and the Crimea region or any of their respective states, provinces, territories subject to countrywide or territory-wide sanctions authorised or imposed by Canada and the United Nations (hereinafter the �Restricted Territory�).

Upon being informed of the fact that a person is a citizen or resident of the Restricted Territory, the Company will treat such an acquisition as void and no Token shall be acquired by the citizen or resident of the Restricted Territory. � Neither the Token nor the Company�s assets shall be considered fiat money.

You also shall take into account the Company�s public announcements with regard to the Sale.

1) Risks of Legal Uncertainty Blockchain, cryptocurrency, and crypto assets have been subject to the regulatory burden in different countries. Some decisions of the countries may cause the malfunctioning of the Company or Token, including but not limited to, prohibitions and limits on the ownership or use of crypto tokens like the Token.

2) Risk of Losing Access to the Token Due to Loss of Credentials Your Token may be associated with your account until the Token is distributed to you. Your account can only be accessed with login credentials opted by you. The loss of such credentials may result in the loss of the Token. It is recommended to store these credentials in a safe place, preferably, with an opportunity to back-up such credentials.

3) Risks Related to Your Credentials Any third party that gains access to your login credentials or private keys may dispose of your Tokens. To avoid such risks, you shall take appropriate security and technical measures.

4) Risk that the Company Will Change Its Plans and Strategy The Company undertakes the Sale which depends on many factors and third-party decisions. Your expectancy with regard to the Token or the Company may differ from the reality for a number of reasons including, but not limited to, the Company�s views with regard to the performance of its strategy or plans.

5) Risk of Insufficient Interest in the Company or its projects There is a probability that the Company will not be interested by a number of individuals and legal entities. Such a lack of interest could cause the Company, value of the Token or other projects of the Company to decrease in worth.

6) Risk of Malfunction in the Company There is a risk of the Company�s malfunction causing the loss or decrease of the Token.

7) Risk of an Illiquid Market for the Token At the time of publication of this document, the Token may not be traded on exchanges. Upon being present on an exchange the Token may cause fraud, experience security failures, or other similar issues. These events may cause a reduction in the value or liquidity of the Token.

8) Risk of Dissolution of the Token There is a risk of unfavourable decreases of the value of the Token. This may result in the impossibility to undertake the Company�s business and may dissolve the Token or to fail to launch the Token.

9) Risk of Cryptography Development of cryptography or other technical means may cause risks to cryptocurrencies, the Company�s services, and the Token.

10) Risk of Security No company in the world can guarantee 100% security of its platforms and services. There may be lacks or mistakes intentionally or unintentionally left which may cause insecurity of the Token.

11) Risk of Theft and Hacking Thieves, hackers, other groups, or criminal organizations may interfere with the Company or Token in various ways, including, but not limited to, DOS or DDoS attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks, smurfing, spoofing, malware attacks, or other attacks which may cause the interference to the Company�s activity, Sale, or Token.
